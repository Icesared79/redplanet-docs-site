# What Atlas Is & The Intelligence Layer

Atlas is not a database. It is not a data vendor. It is not a scraper. It is an autonomous intelligence engine that continuously finds, acquires, normalizes, and improves its own data — without human intervention.

The distinction matters. A database stores what you put into it. Atlas decides what it needs, goes and gets it, verifies it, and makes it queryable. The engine is self-directing — it identifies gaps in its own coverage, discovers new sources to fill them, builds the pipelines to ingest them, and monitors its own health continuously.

## Autonomous by Design

Atlas runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At any given moment hundreds of autonomous runners are active across hundreds of active sources, executing ingestion, normalization, signal generation, and quality verification. The nightly pipeline maintains a 93.4% completion rate across hundreds of concurrent operations — without a team managing it.

When a source fails the system detects it. When coverage gaps emerge the engine identifies them. When data quality degrades below acceptable thresholds it flags it. The system is designed to operate and improve itself continuously.

## Proprietary by Nature

The data asset Atlas has built cannot be purchased from any vendor. It is the product of thousands of source relationships, normalization decisions, and signal generation processes developed over time. Hundreds of millions of verified records across property, transaction, distress, entity, commercial, and climate data — joined, normalized, and queryable as a single coherent asset.

## From Records to Intelligence

Raw records are the foundation. What Atlas builds on top of them is what creates value. A property address, an assessed value, a deed transfer — individually these are facts. Connecting them, contextualizing them, and deriving meaning from them is what turns a data asset into intelligence. Most data providers stop at the record. Atlas starts there.

## What Signals Are

A signal is a derived indicator computed from one or more underlying data points. Where a record tells you what exists, a signal tells you what it means. Atlas generates signals automatically as new data flows through the pipeline — no manual analysis, no human interpretation required.

Current signal categories include:

- Distress indicators — derived from filing activity, tax delinquency, and ownership patterns
- Equity signals — computed from assessed value, transaction history, and debt indicators
- Market velocity signals — derived from transaction frequency and price movement within a geography
- Ownership pattern flags — entity-level signals derived from SOS data, LLC activity, and deed transfer patterns

## Distress Intelligence

Distress is one of the highest-value signal categories in real estate. Atlas tracks distress filings continuously — lis pendens, foreclosure activity, tax delinquency, and court records — and converts them into actionable signals that surface properties and owners under financial stress before that stress becomes public knowledge.

At current scale Atlas has tracked hundreds of thousands of distress filings and generated tens of thousands of distress signals, updated automatically as new filing activity is detected.

## Scoring

Beyond individual signals Atlas produces composite scores — multi-factor rankings that combine several signal inputs into a single actionable output. The NYC Office Conversion Intelligence product scores **1,683** Manhattan buildings across conversion viability, zoning compatibility, debt distress, and market absorption. The CT Solar Intelligence product scores properties across solar potential, roof characteristics, utility rates, and incentive eligibility.

Scoring models are built on top of Atlas data and can be developed for any market, any asset class, and any decision use case.

## Why This Matters Commercially

Intelligence is what clients pay for. Raw data is a commodity — it can be licensed, aggregated, or approximated. Derived intelligence built on a proprietary data asset cannot be replicated without replicating the asset itself. That is the moat.
